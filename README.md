UnrealSplat is a plugin for Unreal Engine 5.5 that enables high-performance, real-time rendering of 3D Gaussian Splatting models. It leverages Unreal's built-in Niagara system to render scenes with up to 2 million splats efficiently.

## ‚úÖ What can the Plugin Do?
The Plugin is still in relatively early development.

* **Niagara-Powered Rendering**: Utilizes Unreal Engine's Niagara system for rendering, ensuring high performance and integration with the engine's VFX pipeline.
* **Large Model Support**: Efficiently renders models with up to 2 million splats.
* **Texture-Based Splat Storage**: Splat properties are stored in textures and loaded on-demand by Niagara for optimal memory and performance.
* **High Performance**: Designed for real-time applications, including VR and interactive walkthroughs.
* **Simple UI**: A straightforward user interface for quick and easy model loading.

## üöß Current Limitations & Known Issues

This plugin is currently in active development. Please be aware of the following limitations:

* **Transformations**: Moving, rotating, or scaling the splat actor in the world is not fully supported. While the actor can be moved, the rendering may break.
* **Spherical Harmonics (SH)**: Support for spherical harmonics is a work-in-progress (WIP) and is currently disabled.
* **Model Size**: Models significantly larger than 2 million splats may not render correctly.
* **File Format**: Only `.ply` files from standard Gaussian Splatting training outputs are currently supported.

## üîß Installation

1.  **Clone the plugin into the Plugins Folder of your Unreal Project**. Itincludes pre-compiled binaries for **Windows 64-bit**.
2.  **Restart your project.** The plugin should be enabled automatically (You might need to rebuild the plugin from your Projects Visual Studio Environment). You can verify this under **Edit > Plugins**.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Place Your Model**: Copy your `.ply` model file somewhere inside your project's `Content/Models` folder (e.g., `Content/Models/my_model.ply`).
2.  **Open the UnrealSplat UI**: A new button named **"UnrealSplat"** will appear on the main toolbar in the editor. Click it to open the loading UI.
3.  **Enter the File Path**: The UI will prompt you for a string. Enter the path to your model **relative to the project's `Content/Models` folder**.
    * For example, if your model is at `[YourProject]/Content/Models/my_model.ply`, you would enter:
        ```
        my_model.ply
        ```
4.  **Load Model**: Press the Render button in the UI. The plugin will create the necessary assets and spawn an actor in your scene to render the model.
